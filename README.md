    *   **Why it impresses:** Showcases the ability to build analytical AI systems that derive insights from unstructured text, generate structured data (scores, strengths/weaknesses), and provide user-centric value – highly valuable for any AI/ML engineering role.

*   **📈 Comprehensive Progress Tracking:**
    *   **What it does:** Saves interview sessions and feedback reports, allowing users to track their improvement over time.
    *   **Why it impresses:** Demonstrates proficiency in data persistence, file system management, and building user-centric features that enhance long-term engagement.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture & Stack

This project is built on a robust and modern AI stack, highlighting proficiency in key industry tools:

*   **🤖 Multi-Agent System:** The core of the application, designed with specialized AI agents (Research, Question Generator, Interview Simulator, Feedback) that collaborate to provide a seamless experience. This demonstrates an understanding of complex AI system design and orchestration.
*   **⛓️ LangChain & LangGraph:** Utilizes these cutting-edge frameworks for building, connecting, and orchestrating the individual AI agents and their complex workflows (state management, conditional transitions). This is a strong indicator of up-to-date AI framework experience.
*   **🌐 Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Implements custom MCP servers for standardized, modular access to external data sources (e.g., local file system for data storage, extensible for web APIs). This showcases an understanding of system integration and flexible architecture design.
*   **🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs):** Powered by OpenAI's GPT models (GPT-3.5-turbo, extensible to GPT-4) for natural language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning tasks.
*   **🐍 Python:** The primary development language.
*   **💻 Streamlit:** Provides an intuitive, interactive, and visually appealing web user interface, demonstrating front-end development capabilities and data visualization skills.
*   **💾 Data Persistence:** Uses JSON files and a custom FileSystem MCP server for storing research data, generated questions, and interview session logs.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the Smart Interview Prep AI on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/smart-interview-prep.git
    cd smart-interview-prep
    ```

2.  **Set up Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date with `langchain`, `langgraph`, `streamlit`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `sqlalchemy`, `pydantic`, `typing-extensions`.)

4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your OpenAI API key:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
        ```
    *   **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It is already included in `.gitignore`.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will open in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

## 💡 Future Enhancements

*   **Voice-Enabled Mock Interviews:** Integrate Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech for a fully immersive conversational experience.
*   **External API Integrations:** Connect to LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or job board APIs for real-time company insights.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Implement a more sophisticated progress dashboard with historical data comparison.
*   **Resume/CV Integration:** Allow users to upload their resume for even more personalized question generation and feedback.
*   **Multi-Interviewer Simulation:** Simulate panels with different interviewer personas.
