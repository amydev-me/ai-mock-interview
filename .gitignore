# Streamlit specific
.streamlit/
# If Streamlit is saving user specific data
# You might have a .streamlit folder which is local to your machine.

# Generated data files (crucial for your project)
data/
# This is important! The 'data/' directory is where your generated
# research, questions, and interview sessions are stored.
# You generally DO NOT want to commit these dynamic, user-specific files to Git.
# If you ever want to include some *sample* data for others to quickly run the app,
# you would create a separate 'sample_data/' folder and commit that instead.
